TODO, in no particular order
 1. Fix known bugs (especially around timezones)
 2. Figure out types and serialization framework
 3. Finalize API
 4. Implement compression
 5. Replace ETs in Query with LINQ ETs
 6. Further C#-ification of implementation
 7. Significantly improve test coverage, particularly by comparing directly against the Java or C++ implementations
 8. Ensure code works with CoreCLR
 9. Ensure code works on non-Windows operating systems
 10. Better dependency story for Protobuf
