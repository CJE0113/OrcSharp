TODO, in no particular order
1. Fix known bugs
2. Figure out types
3. Figure out serialization framework
4. Implement compression
5. Replace ETs in Query with LINQ ETs
6. Further C#-ification
7. Improve test coverage

Some experiments
BooleanWritable -> StrongBox<bool>
ByteWritable -> StrongBox<byte>
etc.
Tried to replace ByteBuffer with MemoryStream; need to undo that partial work in writer.
